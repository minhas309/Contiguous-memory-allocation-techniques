Contiguous memory allocation techniques (First Fir, Best Fit and Worst fit) program c++

Problem Statment:
Given six memory partitions of 300 KB, 600 KB, 350 KB, 200 KB, 750 KB, and 125 KB (in order), how
would the first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit algorithms place processes of size 115 KB, 500 KB, 358 KB, 200
KB, and 375 KB (in order)?
